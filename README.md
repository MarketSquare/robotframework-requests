üè† ``RequestsLibrary`` is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) library
aimed to provide HTTP api testing functionalities by wrapping the well known [Python Requests Library](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests).

## Install stable version
```sh
pip install robotframework-requests
```

## ü§ñ Quick start
```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library               RequestsLibrary

*** Test Cases ***

Quick Get Request Test
    ${response}=    GET  https://www.google.com

Quick Get Request With Parameters Test
    ${response}=    GET  https://www.google.com/search  params=query=ciao  expected_status=200

Quick Get A JSON Body Test
    ${response}=    GET  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
    Should Be Equal As Strings    1  ${response.json()}[id]
```

### What's new in 0.9
Sessionless keywords are now available, you can just `GET`, `POST`, etc.. no need to create a session anymore!
```robotframework
${resp}=  GET  https://www.google.com
```

`Status Should Be` and `Request Should Be Successfull` can use the last response, no need to pass the response anymore!
```robotframework
GET  https://www.google.com
Status Should Be  200
```

### What's new in 0.8

**New keywords structure:**
All requests keywords have been rewritten because of many not backward compatible changes
and to allow in the near future requests keywords without a session.
Example `Get Request` become `GET On Session` and soon there will be also just `GET`
when a session is not needed.
Old keywords `* Request` are now deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.0 version.

**Implicit assert on status code:**
`* On Session` keywords automatically fail if an error status code is returned.
`expect_status=` could be used to specify a status code (`201`, `OK`, `Bad request`)
or `any` if you want to evaluate the response in any case.

**Closer to the original Requests library:**
New keywords have the same parameter orders and structure as the original.
Lot of pre-parsing / encoding has been removed to have a more accurate and unchanged behaviour.

**Cleaner project architecture:**
Main keywords file has been split with a more logic division to allow better and faster maintenance.
