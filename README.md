``RequestsLibrary`` is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) test library that uses the [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) HTTP client.

# Usage

Install robotframework-requests and it's dependencies via ``pip``

```bash
pip install -U requests
pip install -U robotframework-requests
```

Here is a sample test case:

RequestsLibrary tries to follow the same API as requests. In the above example, we load in the ``RequestsLibrary`` using the ``Library`` keyword. To be able to distinguish HTTP requests to different hosts and for ease of creation of test cases, you need to create a `Session`. Internally this will create a `request.Session` object.  The `Create Session` keyword accepts two arguments:

* _alias_ to identify the session later
* _root url_ to the server

HTTP verbs are mapped keywords which accept two arguments:

* _alias_ identifying the Session we created earlier. 
* _URI_  to send the request to.

Above we create two Sessions - one to the _github api_, and the other to _google_. Creating sessions doesn't send any requests.

After we create a Session we can send any of the following ``Get, Post, Put, Patch, Options, Delete, and Head`` requests. In the above example we send a GET request to the session with the alias _google_ and check the HTTP response code. Then send a another GET request but this time to the session with the alias _github_ and pass in a `uri`. In this case it is ``/users/bulkan`` which will return a JSON string. `RequestsLibrary` returned object provides a method to get the content as a JSON object format called json().

Here is another test case where an outbound http proxy is used.
