        Fails if response status code is different than the expected.

        ``expected_status`` could be the code number as an integer or as string.
        But it could also be a named status code like 'ok', 'created', 'accepted' or
        'bad request', 'not found' etc.

        ``response`` is the output of other requests keywords like `GET` or `GET On Session`.
        If omitted the last response will be used.

        In case of failure an HTTPError will be automatically raised.
        A custom failure message ``msg`` can be added like in built-in keywords.

        New requests keywords like `GET` or `GET On Session` (starting from 0.8 version) already have an implicit assert
        mechanism that, by default, verifies the response status code.
        `Status Should Be` keyword can be useful when you disable implicit assert using ``expected_status=anything``.

        For example when you have a nested keyword that is used for both OK and ERROR responses:

        | ``auth`` | Auth tuple to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth. |
        | ``timeout`` | How many seconds to wait for the server to send data before giving up, as a float, or a ``(connect timeout, read timeout)`` tuple. |

        | ``verify``  | Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether we verify the server's TLS certificate, or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle to use. Defaults to ``${True}``. Warning: if a session has been created with ``verify=${False}`` any other requests will not verify the SSL certificate. |
        | ``stream`` | if ``${False}``, the response content will be immediately downloaded. |
